# Player Hooks Structure

Export a single object typed as `RpgPlayerHooks` with lifecycle hooks. Use typed parameters.

```typescript
const player: RpgPlayerHooks = {
    onConnected(player: RpgPlayer) {
        // Initialize player
    },
    onInput(player: RpgPlayer, { input }) {
        // Handle input
    },
    async onJoinMap(player: RpgPlayer) {
        // Map join logic
    }
}
export default player
```

Common hooks: `onConnected`, `onInput`, `onJoinMap`, `onLevelUp`, `onDead`. Always annotate `player` as `RpgPlayer`.
